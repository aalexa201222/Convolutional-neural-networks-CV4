# Convolutional Neural Networks with Fashion MNIST


## Overview
This project involves training and validating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The primary objective is to gain hands-on experience with CNN models, focusing on different architectural variants to enhance performance. This experience serves as foundational knowledge for more complex assignments.

## Key Features
- **Fashion MNIST Dataset**: Utilizes 60k training and 10k test grayscale images across ten clothing categories.
- **CNN Variants**: Develops five model variants, each differing by one architectural feature to study their impact on performance.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluates models using a validation set, with extensive testing including a test set performance comparison.

## Software and Installation
- **Python 3.6+**: Recommended for all development and testing.
- **PyTorch**: Primary framework used for model development.
- **CUDA GPU**: If available, enables significant speed-up in model training.
